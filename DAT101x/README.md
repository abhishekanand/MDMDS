## Module 1: An Introduction to Data   
### Exploring Data :
#### Getting Started with Data :

Temporal Data
Text 
    Categorical
Numerical Varable 
	Continuous 
    Discrete
#### Sorting and Filtering Data
    Ascending 
    Descending

    Outlier Value : Exteme Value 

#### Derived Data 
    Example  : Revenue = Sales * Price 

#### Highlighting Data 
    Higlight comparative numeric value 
        Using color intentiity  - also called Heat Map 
        Using relative size uisng Data bar 
        Using certain criteria 

## Module 2: Data Analysis Fundamentals  
### Analyzing and Visualizing Data   
#### Aggregating Data
Aggregating data is usually the first kind of analysis you perform in order to summarize the data and get a feel for it as a whole .

* How many records are in the Data Set  - Count 
* For categorical data, you might want to calculate something called the distinct count; which counts how many distinct values that are.
    
    - Sum 
    - Average
    - Minimum 
    - Maximum 


#### Grouping and Summarizing Data
When your dataset includes categorical values, it's common to group the data by categories and calculate subtotals for numeric values

When there are multiple categories, you can group them into hierarchies to get multi-level subtotals.

#### Visualizing Data
It's generally easier to identify and explore trends and relationships in your data by creating visualizations - variously referred to as graphs plots or charts. 

* Line Chart  :
    - X axis 
    - Y axis 
    - Legend 
    - Tick Labels
    - Title 

* Pie Chart :
* Bar Chart /Column Chart  - Bar charts are often used to compare numeric values across categories. You can compare across multiple
* Scatter Plot : To compare two numeric values, you can use a scatter plot
